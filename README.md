## Hello!ðŸ‘‹ A little bit about me:

My name is Carrie Cox, and I am a full-time graduate student at the University of Iowa. I graduated in May 2022 with my B.B.A. in Marketing Management. I am currently studying at the Tippie College of Business to obtain my Master of Business Analytics degree. 

My passion for data and analytics stems from my love for marketing strategy. I studied marketing in undergrad and was highly interested in consumer behavior and marketing research. I have found that I view data differently for this reason, I have a natural inclination to spot trends that back a businessâ€™s strategy without consciously thinking about it. I am currently working as a consumer insights analyst for Caseyâ€™s Data & Analytics team, and have become proficient in Power BI and drawing insights using SQL. 

I am also skilled in Python, R, and Tableau, Orange Data Mining, and JMP from my college courses. My repositories consist of projects from my MSBA courses over the last year and a half.

Combining my work and academic experience, I have developed a strong passion for data visualization, storytelling, and consumer behavior. I strive to be a leader, team-player, hard-worker, and excellent communicator in personal and professional settings and would like to transfer these skills into creating a career for myself.
